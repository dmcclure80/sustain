      <p>I am interested in sustainablilty. Our Planet supports us with life in abundance. How do we maintain our responsibility to long-term survival of the eco-system? I believe that conscousness is raising with regard to the challenges as well as
        solutions; some proven and some potential. I would like to support a continuing evolution of being in balance with; whether it be our own personal issues, how we are treating each other, or how we treat our mother Earth and all of our fellow
        species.</p>
        <p>
          Look at my <a href=why.html#beliefs>Why</a></a> page to see more on what I believe.
        </p>
        <p>The second law of thermodynamics states that any part of a system that is isolated will naturally degrade into chaos.  By isolating ourselves from the environment, and each other, we experience continuing breakdown of our personal relationships as well as the habitat that supports our very being.  We come from nature at inception and birth; we return to it at death.  Environmental nutrients support our growth throughout our lifetime.</p>
      <p>Many times we look at symptoms and then look for a bandaid solution that masks the symptom. This is true in our relationships, medicine and other disciplines as well as environmental issues. We need to take the time to look at the whole and
        determine root cause so we can move to results that enable for the long term. In other words how do we look at cause and effect and determine our needed shift to reach a desired sustainable change that will last.

        <h3>Soil Restoration</h3>
        <p><img class="image-left" width=190px; height=250px; src="images/soil-regen.JPG" alt="soil" />The United States experienced the dust Bowl 1920's due to among other things lack of crop rotation and composting for regenerating soil.
          Petroleum products were
          introduced after WWII. Nitrogen and phosphates to green crops in 50's, but with
          loss of nutrients. As I was growing up in the 1950's in an agricultural area I observed the start of large corporations taking over family farms and introducing herbacides and various other sprays to the crops to control insects as
          well. By the late 60's we were having conversations about how the cancer rates were so much higher than what we experienced in our youth. As I have continued to observe the evolution of GMO plants and herbacides, I continue to
          see the
          reduction in the overall health of the population, along with the associated higher healthcare costs. I believe there is a direct coorelation between the use of GMO plants along with the herbacides / pesticides and the health
          issues we
          are experiencing.
          Research
          has shown that the GMO, herbacide model is not working as the crop yields are dropping each year. There are farmers that are now changing that paradigm back towards healthy soil and organic methods that produce much higher crop
          yield.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason we need to restore our soil is that it is the key to Environmental Health.  Soil that is restored to its natural state is the most effective carbon sequestration. There is no way to draw carbon out of the atmoshphere that is more practical than the regeneration of soil and the move towards regenerative agriculture.

        <p><Strong>The Biggest Little Farm</Strong> The following movie is about Apricot Lane Farms: a traditional foods farm started by John and Molly Chester, a husband and wife team, who left their jobs in Los Angeles to become farmers
          and pursue their dream vision of starting
          Apricot Lane
          Farms in 2011. Located 40 miles north of Los Angeles, the farm is dedicated to the mission of creating a well-balanced eco-system and rich soils that produce nutrient-dense foods while treating the environment and the animals with
          respect.
          Apricot Lane farm residents include pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, guinea hens, horses, highland cattle, and one brown swiss dairy cow named “Maggie.” Many of which, you will meet in the BIGGEST LITTLE FARM. The land consists
          of
          Biodynamic Certified avocado and lemon orchards, a vegetable garden, pastures, and over 75 varieties of stone fruit. (Above explanation lifted from The Biggest Little Farm website) <br />

          I am so excited by this clear example of the ability to turn our entire food production system to healthy sustainbable nutrient dense foods within seven years. (Highly recommend this movie / documentary with great cinematography).<br />

          It is exciting that there are a number of organizations now picking up the baton to promote a sustainable future. While a number of these organizations are using methods posing enemies to draw attention to their cause there is
          still a
          process of raising awareness that adds value. I would prefer that organizations promote inclusive discussions with the associations they are opposing as the first step to provide collaborative activism. Rather than being against
          anything I would like everyone to ask the question: <strong>"Is what I am about to do providing or promoting a sustainable solution for myself, my loved ones and everyone else on the planet?"</strong><br />

        <h3>Healthy Aging</h3>
        <p>
          We are in an exciting time! The expected life span has continued to rise for most of the last one hundred years. Today we face the challenges presented by toxins and processed foods which are reducing our ability to sustain an
          active
          healthy life in these added years. We are on the verge of being able to regenerate in natural ways vital organs in the body and using stem cells to enable the body to heal itself in many cases. An active nutrient dense lifestyle
          free
          of toxins is what has been shown to enable vitality into advanced age.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Resources for Healthy Aging:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Hugs - the most healing modality!</strong> <br /> In 2011 I learned the healing power of hugs. After a bicycle accident that left me with 14 broken bones and a mild concussion, I spent 5 days in a trauma unit, and 2 weeks
          in a
          rehab facility. Several weeks later I had surgery to have a plate put on top of my left collar bone.
          During recovery as I encountered others in the community I would get many hugs each day. I became convinced that these were indeed healing. My accident was on April 11, and during the second week of September I was able to do the
          Five
          Lakes
          Hike at Alpine Meadows in the Sierras. A five mile roundtrip hike with 1000 ft elevation gain. <br /> <a href="https://www.happify.com/hd/8-reasons-why-you-need-at-least-8-hugs-a-day/">8 Reasons Why We Need at Least 8

        <h3>Love and Compassion</h3>
        <p> When thinking about Sustainability I often consider things like climate, renewable energy, water, and conditions that are mostly physical. When
          I began to move through this exercise of providing resources for understanding and sustaining that which we all hold dear, I realized upon reflection, that this needs to go beyond the traditional and consider those things that can assist
          us in bridging the gaps we are experiencing in todays world. Divisions need to be crossed. The best way I can think of at this point is to consider how we can sustain Love and Compassion. Some projects that I believe are assisting in
          those efforts follow.

          curricula, conferences, films, and mass mobilizations rooted in the ethic of love. Because
          love is not just a feeling but a form of sweet labor — fierce, bloody, imperfect, and life-giving. In this era of enormous rage, Revolutionary Love is the call of our times.<br />

          I am so excited by the potential of resolving issues through love and compassion and how Revolutionary Love Project is moving us closer to that with practical suggestions for resolution.<br />

          that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life. (Lifted from the expanation of the book.)<br />

        <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>
          We only need to look out the window at nature to see that diversity produces the strongest solutions. This seems true at the universe level as well as the micro level. Yet as humans we separate ourselves and diminish the strength
          of
          diversity. At this time we need to embrace diversity in all forms to enable our ability to collaborate. <br />In my experience one of the best examples of this realization is:

          None of the above subjects will ever come to complete fruition unless we somehow bring a state of amity to all reaches of the planet. <br><strong>"We Are One"</br> It is time for a new way of thinking!</strong>
          <br />
          In the last 100 years or so the human species has developed methods of destruction that threatens our very survival. Chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons all have the potential to end life on this planet.
          <br />
          We must all work together to bring a new response to each potential confrontation. When something controversial happens we often get defensive and experience the desire to lash out in reaction. In each of these instances there lies
          an
          opportunity to decide in favor of what is best for all.
          <br />
          In other words:<br /> <strong>“Mindfulness is a pause. It’s the space between reaction and response. That is where choice lives.” <br />~ Kerry McClure</strong>
          <br />
          How are you choosing to pause and respond?
