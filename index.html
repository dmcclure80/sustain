        For what purpose has Mother Earth enabled me here at this time?<br />

        Regeneration with Sustainable consciousness is increasing and there are more resources for enabling it in ways that speak to cooperation, coordination, collaboration and reciprocity. It is an exciting time where physics is now providing the proof that we can move forward with solutions that are in resonance instead of continuing our history of disonance.
        <br />
        I have experienced many purposes in this life, many of them totally unconscious.
        <br />
        At this time I know that my purpose is to share solutions that are leading us towards regenerating where  needed, and enabling a sustainable future that will support life!  We cannot sustain the status quo. Sustainability through regeneration is required to bring us back to what was truly sustainable before humans intervened in erroneous ways.
      </p>
      <p>I love regeneration and sustainablilty. Our Planet supports us with life in abundance. How do we maintain our responsibility to long-term survival of the eco-system? I would like to support a continuing evolution of being in balance with; whether it be our
        own personal issues, how we are treating each other, or how we treat our mother Earth and all of our fellow species.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at my <a href=why.html#beliefs>Why</a></a> page to see more on what I believe.
      </p>
      <p>The second law of thermodynamics states that any part of a system that is isolated will naturally degrade into chaos. By isolating ourselves from the environment, and each other, we experience continuing breakdown of our personal
        relationships as well as the habitat that supports our very being. We come from nature at inception and birth; we return to it at death. Environmental nutrients support our growth throughout our lifetime.</p>
      <p>Many times we look at symptoms and then look for a bandaid solution that masks the symptom. This is true in our relationships, medicine and other disciplines as well as environmental issues. We need to take the time to look at the whole and
        determine root cause so we can move to results that enable for the long term. In other words how do we look at cause and effect and determine our needed shift to reach a desired sustainable change that will last.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many working hard at providing solutions that are in sync. These solutions need to be put forth and supported so that they can be more widely used and enable recovery and long term balance.  This site provides insights into solutions.  You will only see contextual information here about the problems as they are so apparant and easily researchable elsewhere.  <strong>Let us come together to enable solutions.</strong>

          <h3>Resonance</h3>
          <p>
            Since humans stepped out of our hunter gatherer domain into agriculture and city dwelling, we have been augmenting our life style through inventions that are primarily in dissonance.  In other words, not in balance with nature.  We started burning coal for heat, cooking, etc., and later oil and gas.  This is just one example of where we enable disonance instead of resonance. Air, soil, water, all living things are affected by our pollution in the name of enhancing our comforts and is now largely drivin by profit motivation rather than safety.<br /><br /><img class="image-left" width=250px; height=25px; src="images/ResonanceScience.png" alt="RS" />There is a growing number of areas where the latest physics supports bringing our lifestyles back into resonance and enabling a better outcome. Nassim Haramein of Resonance Science is now educating on the new physics that enables many areas return to resonance.<br />

            There are a number of resources that do not fit within the subjects I have chosen to discuss individually, or are of high enough interest to list in this separate section.<br />
            Recently David Attenborough released a new film (A Life On Our Planet) about his life and what he has seen happen since he started his work. It is a chronical of the devastaion he has seen, with a call to action that shows we have time
            to fix much of this if we act quickly. It is currently available on Netflix and well worth watching. <br />

            <br />
            Stepping back and viewing life on planet earth from a systems view provides a clear case for why we must reemerge ourselves in working with nature rather than extracting from it. Each extraction needs a plan to reuse, recycle, with
            support for life.
            The book by Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi "The Systems View of Life - A Unifying Vision" provides an in depth case for our participation in that which we come from and will go back to. This book is also available on iBooks.

          <h3>Soil Restoration</h3>
          <p><img class="image-left" width=190px; height=250px; src="images/soil-regen.JPG" alt="soil" />From a sustainability and nutrition perspective I believe that the area we can get the most bank for the buck is through soil regeneration. <br />The United
            States experienced the dust Bowl 1920's due to among other things over tilling, lack of crop rotation and composting for regenerating soil.
            Petroleum products were
            introduced after WWII. Nitrogen and phosphates to green crops in 50's, but with
            loss of nutrients. As I was growing up in the 1950's in an agricultural area I observed the start of large corporations taking over family farms and introducing herbacides and various other sprays to the crops to control insects as
            well. By the late 60's we were having conversations about how the cancer rates were so much higher than what we experienced in our youth. As I have continued to observe the evolution of GMO plants and herbacides, I continue to
            see the
            reduction in the overall health of the population, along with the associated higher healthcare costs. I believe there is a direct coorelation between the use of GMO plants along with the herbacides / pesticides and the health
            issues we
            are experiencing.
            Research
            has shown that the GMO, herbacide model is not working as the crop yields are dropping each year. There are farmers that are now changing that paradigm back towards healthy soil and organic methods that produce much higher crop
            yield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason we need to restore our soil is that it is the key to Environmental Health. Soil that is restored to its natural state is the most effective carbon sequestration. There is no way to draw carbon out of the atmoshphere that
            is more practical than the regeneration of soil and the move towards regenerative agriculture.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Resources for Soil Regeneration:</strong></p>
          <p><Strong>The Biggest Little Farm</Strong> The following movie is about Apricot Lane Farms: a traditional foods farm started by John and Molly Chester, a husband and wife team, who left their jobs in Los Angeles to become farmers
            and pursue their dream vision of starting
            Apricot Lane
            Farms in 2011. Located 40 miles north of Los Angeles, the farm is dedicated to the mission of creating a well-balanced eco-system and rich soils that produce nutrient-dense foods while treating the environment and the animals with
            respect.
            Apricot Lane farm residents include pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, guinea hens, horses, highland cattle, and one brown swiss dairy cow named “Maggie.” Many of which, you will meet in the BIGGEST LITTLE FARM. The land consists
            of
            Biodynamic Certified avocado and lemon orchards, a vegetable garden, pastures, and over 75 varieties of stone fruit. (Above explanation lifted from The Biggest Little Farm website) <br />

            I am so excited by this clear example of the ability to turn our entire food production system to healthy sustainbable nutrient dense foods within seven years. (Highly recommend this movie / documentary with great cinematography).<br />

            is a unique, no till, ecologically beneficial, high intensive vegetable farm in Sonoma County California. This farm has more than quadrupled the organic material in their soil (which means more nutrient dense food) - all while producing
            over six times the state average of harvest revenue per acre per year. They have brought back tremendous populations of pollinators, beneficial insects, and vertabrates (natural pest control). They use less water to produce their to
            produce their vegetables because of the supercharged soil organic matter. They use no sprays of any kind, not even organic sprays. They have year around employees with job security. <br />

            that pollute our source of life. <br /><br /></p>

            It is exciting that there are a number of organizations now picking up the baton to promote a sustainable future. While a number of these organizations are using methods posing enemies to draw attention to their cause there is
            still a
            process of raising awareness that adds value. I would prefer that organizations promote inclusive discussions with the associations they are opposing as the first step to provide collaborative activism. Rather than being against
            anything I would like everyone to ask the question: <strong>"Is what I am about to do providing or promoting a sustainable solution for myself, my loved ones and everyone else on the planet?"</strong><br />

          <h3>Healthy Aging</h3>
          <p>
            We are in an exciting time! The expected life span has continued to rise for most of the last one hundred years. Today we face the challenges presented by toxins and processed foods which are reducing our ability to sustain an
            active
            healthy life in these added years. We are on the verge of being able to regenerate in natural ways vital organs in the body and using stem cells to enable the body to heal itself in many cases. An active nutrient dense lifestyle
            free
            of toxins is what has been shown to enable vitality into advanced age.

          <p><strong>Hugs - the most healing modality!</strong> <br /> In 2011 I learned the healing power of hugs. After a bicycle accident that left me with 14 broken bones and a mild concussion, I spent 5 days in a trauma unit, and 2 weeks
            in a
            rehab facility. Several weeks later I had surgery to have a plate put on top of my left collar bone.
            During recovery as I encountered others in the community I would get many hugs each day. I became convinced that these were indeed healing. My accident was on April 11, and during the second week of September I was able to do the
            Five
            Lakes
            Hike at Alpine Meadows in the Sierras. A five mile roundtrip hike with 1000 ft elevation gain. <br /> <a href="https://www.happify.com/hd/8-reasons-why-you-need-at-least-8-hugs-a-day/">8 Reasons Why We Need at Least 8

          <h3>Love and Compassion</h3>
          <p> When thinking about Sustainability I often consider things like climate, renewable energy, water, and conditions that are mostly physical. When
            I began to move through this exercise of providing resources for understanding and sustaining that which we all hold dear, I realized upon reflection, that this needs to go beyond the traditional and consider those things that can assist
            us in bridging the gaps we are experiencing in todays world. Divisions need to be crossed. The best way I can think of at this point is to consider how we can sustain Love and Compassion. Some projects that I believe are assisting in
            those efforts follow.

            curricula, conferences, films, and mass mobilizations rooted in the ethic of love. Because
            love is not just a feeling but a form of sweet labor — fierce, bloody, imperfect, and life-giving. In this era of enormous rage, Revolutionary Love is the call of our times. Valarie Kaur and her team are doing amazing things!<br />

        <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>
          We only need to look out the window at nature to see that diversity produces the strongest solutions. This seems true at the universe level as well as the micro level. Yet as humans we separate ourselves and diminish the strength
          of
          diversity. At this time we need to embrace diversity in all forms to enable our ability to collaborate. <br />In my experience one of the best examples of this realization is:

          None of the above subjects will ever come to complete fruition unless we somehow bring a state of amity to all reaches of the planet. <br><strong>"We Are One"</br> It is time for a new way of thinking!</strong>

          In the last 100 years or so the human species has developed methods of destruction that threatens our very survival. Chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons all have the potential to end life on this planet.

          We must all work together to bring a new response to each potential confrontation. When something controversial happens we often get defensive and experience the desire to lash out in reaction. In each of these instances there lies
          an
          opportunity to decide in favor of what is best for all.
          <br />
          In other words:<br /> <strong>“Mindfulness is a pause. It’s the space between reaction and response. That is where choice lives.” <br />~ Kerry McClure</strong>

        <h3>Zero Waste</h3>
        <p>
          One of the key principles for long term survival is for humanity to realize that each of us comes from the environment which surrounds us and we shall return to it. This leads us to the realization that if we support the environment, it
          will support us. Each new product that we develop needs to be designed with this in mind. Whatever resources we consume must in some way be recycled after use. One products waste becomes another product that eventually cycles to a return
          to a natural state that supports all life.

          <p>
            Zero Emissions Research Initiatives ZERI strives to eliminate the very idea of waste.

            The website is at zeri.org, but it is not secure.

            Iceland is now producing 100% of their energy from renewable resources. They are aware that the more they enable zero waste the more likely it enables long term survival. Netflix has a series "Down to Earth with Zac Efron" which has an
            episode on Iceland that highlights a number of efforts at zero waste in the country.

        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>
          An economy based on just dollars as a measurement of growth is one of the reasons we are having the ecological challenges we are facing.

          A new way of thinking is required where we encapsulate all aspects of any activity to ensure that its outcome has a aspect of potential for balance. </p>
